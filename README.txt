This project hosts Eclipse plugins supporting Java development on Amazons Web Services EC2.

Most of this project is for educational purposes. Currently, the focus of the 
project is to assist with the deployment of OSGi based web-applications onto an instance of
EC2. Support for Virgo is first on the agenda.
